// 6.	Stripping Names:
// Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
// Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, 
//so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

const User_name = '\tHarryPoter\n ';

console.log(User_name);
// expected output: "   Harry Poter    ";

console.log('\tHarry Poter\n');
